# Registration Overview
At a high-level, there are two types of registration: Company and New User. A company is either a partner or a customer that is using the Developer Portal Solution Center to administer their solutions on the platform. Companies must be invited to join the platform, and during registration, their top-level organizations and initial user accounts are created. A new user will receive an invite from the Security Administrator for registration. For additional information regarding the registration process visit:
